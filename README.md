## Supported Datasets

Currently this repository targets the collection of demonstration datasets to train [transporter networks](https://transporternets.github.io/) on real robots. Sample datasets are published [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/peterdavidfagan/transporter_networks).

## Getting Started

This application requires both intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, for support on getting both your camera intrinsics and extrinsics please consult the [moveit2_camera_calibration](https://github.com/peterdavidfagan/moveit2_camera_calibration/tree/main) repository. 

Detailed documentation and instructions to be added in future.
